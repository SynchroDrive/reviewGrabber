 Douglas Mulford, 12/25/2015,CHEM141,"Very good, but exams are not like high school and sometimes required us to know it in more depth than in class, but I hear the same thing happens in orgo so at least it won't be a slap in the face.  The group learning was funner than just sitting and taking notes. Even though exams were kind of hard, he had high avg. so work hard, no curve.",4,5,2
 Douglas Mulford, 12/24/2015,CHEM141,"Dr. Mulford has been test driving the use of the group learning and has almost completely stopped lecturing in class. I found that the tests were much much harder and more in depth than what is covered in class. There are better, more helpful Chemistry teachers at Emory.",1,1,1
 Douglas Mulford, 12/13/2015,CHEM141,"Do not take this man. He thinks he is funny and that students love him, but in reality, he has no care in the world for students' learning. He hardly ever lectures, but still expects you to turn up to class. Also, he puts material on his tests which is not covered in the text book. This man deterred me from ever taking chemistry again.",1,1,1
 Douglas Mulford, 08/20/2015,CHEM141,Mulford's lecture is not as good as hyped. He tends to tell distracting jokes and speaks in a pace which is quite hard for one to catch up. His lecture is all textbook but his test is beyond those behind the book questions. For someone who is not a science major I wouldn't recommend taking him. His test is also much longer than other instructors'.,4,4,2
 Douglas Mulford, 08/12/2015,141,I learned nothing from his class and he discouraged me from ever taking chem again. Tests are ridiculously hard and he is not that great of a lecturer for it to be worth it. There are much better professors at emory.,1,1,1
 Douglas Mulford, 07/22/2015,CHEM141,I found his tests to be extremely difficult.,3,3,1
 Douglas Mulford, 06/01/2015,CHEM141,Good lectures but his exams are much harder than he lectures on. It's just gen chem and his lectures are not THAT awesome that it will be worth all the work you have to put into this class. Avoid if possible.,2,4,1
 Douglas Mulford, 04/14/2015,CHEM141,Dr. Mulford is a great lecturer. He's very fair on grading tests and HAS EXTRA CREDIT (at least 10 points per test)! Sure he's suppose to be hard but Chemistry is hard and Mulford is the best lecturer there is. Do the problem sets!!! A good chunk of the test is math so make sure you practice. (PS. watch out for smiley faces. :) +2 pts.),4,5,2
 Douglas Mulford, 04/10/2015,141,"Great lecturer and clearly explains the topics to make sure everyone understands. I took him again for 142. Many people hype that his tests are impossible, but if you pay attention in lecture and do his assigned problems you will be fine. In addition he gives extra credit on all tests.",5,5,3
 Douglas Mulford, 04/03/2015,CHEM142,This class defined my freshman year experience. It remains the hardest class I've ever taken in undergrad. I've never felt more accomplished than when I aced one of his tests. Lectures are some of the best you'll get at Emory,4,5,1
 Douglas Mulford, 03/19/2015,CHEM141,"Very good lecturer. Clear and answers questions clearly. If you study what he teaches, you will pass. Rarely gives anything super tricky in terms of things you've never seen before. Most test problems do require multiple conceptscalculations to solve. Either way, still a very good teacher. Show up and study, you should be fine.",4,5,4
 Douglas Mulford, 01/20/2015,CHEM141,"Dr. Mulford is a fantastic professor and a lecturer. He's very clear in class and there isn't anything on the test that he didn't go over or didn't assign in the book. People say that he's tests are hard but if you pay attention in class, do the back of the book problems, the supplemental questions, and read the book you can definitely get an A.",4,5,2
 Douglas Mulford, 01/16/2015,CHEM141,"Mulford is one of the hardest chemistry teachers at Emory. However, he is one of the fairest and one of the best. All of his hard questions are pulled from the textbook. Be ready to work for your grade. He will help you if you go in and ask for it.",5,5,1
 Douglas Mulford, 01/14/2015,141,Great lecturer but hard tests. Loved the class,5,5,2
 Douglas Mulford, 12/27/2014,CHEM141,"Mulford was good in lecture, but the lecture was oversimplified compared to the test. The practice questions sometimes reflected the tests but many questions on his test often felt trivial and too long. Would not take ever again.",3,3,1
 Douglas Mulford, 12/21/2014,141,Professor Mulford is a fantastic lecturer. He makes the concepts and the math behind chemistry easily understandable and accessible to even those with no AP background. He is nice and helpful in office hours and does his best to accommodate his students's schedules if they need to meet outside of office hours. Wish I could take him next semester.,4,5,2
 Douglas Mulford, 12/18/2014,141,"If you enjoy studying what is presented in lecture just to find tangentially related material on tests, Mulford is your man. He almost takes pride in being a difficult grader. Also, he's dismissive in office hours.",3,3,2
 Douglas Mulford, 12/03/2014,CHEM141,"His test is just not related to the material we learn either in class or in the assignment. I did all the assigned question (besides the hw), had plenty of practice in lewis structures, but still got 85 on the exam simply because he tested something that he only spoke of in 2 minutes and never appears on the book. Horrible teacher.",3,5,2
 Douglas Mulford, 11/29/2014,141,"Good lecturer, but you must pay attention to the resources he gives you to do well in the class. You won't pass with no effort.",3,4,2
 Douglas Mulford, 11/23/2014,CHEM142,"As a lecturer, Mulford did a decent job. Although he is clear, he goes very fast, and you have to make sure you study before every class for his clicker questions and to keep up with the material. Don't fall behind. Do the assigned questions. Unfortunately, neither will guarantee a good grade. His tests are hard. Would not recommend.",3,4,2
